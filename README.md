Music , Radio and Podcasts Streaming
Project Implementation

1. Introduction

      Listening expands an individual's thoughts , perspective and state of mind 
The best way to spend a time off is to listen to favourite music, radio or podcast 
The core idea of my application is to stream music , radio and podcasts online based upon the user preferences in a single tap 

2 Design and Implementation

Login Page
Existing users can login while new users may sign up for an account

Explore Page

Switch to music , radio or podcasts
Users may create , edit and share their own playlists 
It improves engagement with the application and draws new users attention
They may search/add their preferred artists , albums , language and genre
This enables the application to render more personalised user-friendly content
Predominantly used UI components are adapted for the media controls such as play, pause, rewind , forward, download , loop , shuffle , search and the like
Familiarity with icons makes the user experience easier
This page was in my design but achieving it in implementation seemed to be a great deal and yet to be completed



3.Conclusions
This project has been a great learning 
Trying to achieve the design as such was challenging that I had to make certain compromises with the same 
Expecting to further improve my work
I felt that I must have chosen a more simpler application which is kind of static as the first step
